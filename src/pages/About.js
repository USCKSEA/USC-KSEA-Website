            <p className="font-bold underline">At the national scale:</p>

            <p>KSEA was established in 1971 as a non-profit professional organization and has grown to over 5000 registered members with 67 local chapters/branches, 30 affiliated professional societies, and 14 technical groups across the United States. KSEAâ€™s vision is to become a premier professional organization which fosters international cooperation between the U.S. and Korea, cares for its members, and serves the community.</p>

            <p className="mx-auto"><a href="https://www.ksea.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://ksea.org</a></p>

            <p>In addition to working professionals in KSEA, there are several student and young professional-led KSEA chapters across the country called Young Generation (YG) groups. YG groups work within their respective local chapters and/or universities to serve their communities while working with the KSEA YG National Board and other groups to maintain active communication between students around the United States. As of 2021-2022, <span className="font-bold">more than 20 YG groups are active</span>, with 50+ groups documented during KSEA's history. Participating groups in the KSEA network are shown below and also listed in the main KSEA website.</p>

            <p className="mx-auto">USC KSEA is proud to have named <span className="font-bold text-red-500">YG Group of the Year</span> in <span className="underline">both</span> 2020-21 and 2021-22 Academic Years.</p>

            <p>KSEA is also a <span className="font-bold italic">Presidential Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) </span>certified organization, which can recognize students, young adults, and professionals who dedicate time to KSEA-related activities for volunteerism. USC students who actively participate in KSEA activities will be nominated by our executive board for qualifying awards at the end of the school year.</p>
